          The first step in the competition is to use the BIG website to submit
          an application by the deadline. Following the screening of
          applications, the selected applicants will participate in a pitching
          session in the second round. The judges will assess the initiative
          based on a variety of factors, including its creativity, viability,
          impact, business potential, team, consumer demands, and market demand.
          After being chosen, the entrepreneurs will take part in a three-day
          boot camp where they will get coaching and guidance in order to get
          ready for the last pitching session. The top 51 startups, one of which
          will win the BIG prize, will be selected by the knowledgeable panel of
          judges.<br />
